### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Javier Rivas from Spain. 
For years I have been interested in programming and I have had various approaches, through training courses but in a non-professional way but rather as an amateur. 
Finally, six months ago, in September 2021, I decided to make software development my profession. 
So, I took a FullStack development bootcamp and now that I finished it, I feel much more confident that this dream can come true.
Never stop dreaming
