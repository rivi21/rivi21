### Hi there, I am Javier | Web Developer | ðŸ‘‹
  from Spain. 
For years I have been interested in programming and I have had various approaches, through training courses but in a non-professional way but rather as an amateur. 
Finally, in September 2021, I decided to make software development my profession. 
So, I took a FullStack development bootcamp and now that I finished it, I feel much more confident that this dream can come true.
Never stop dreaming

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently improving data visualization in a full-stack CRM project with React+MySQL+Symfony stack.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning D3.js library for visualization data, PHP 8.1, Symfony 6 and Docker.
